>The following list details **common** technologies and practices found in Scala shops.

1. **Git:** Git is the defacto standard version control software. Popular providers include: Github ( https://github.com/features ) and Gitlab ( https://about.gitlab.com ). Both can be installed on an internal network.
2. **IDE:** Scala IDEs include Jetbrains Intellij IDEA ( https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/ ) and VS Code ( https://code.visualstudio.com ) with Metals ( https://scalameta.org/metals/ ).
3. **SBT:** The Scala Build Tool ( https://www.scala-sbt.org ) is a build and dependency management tool, extensible via plugins. SBT is dominant in the Scala space. Mill is a viable option. Maven and Gradle are secondary options.
4. **Maven Repository:** SBT requires network access to the public Maven repository ( https://mvnrepository.com ) to obtain versioned libraries. A continually updated copy of the public Maven Repository can be set up and maintained internally via products like Nexus ( https://www.sonatype.com/nexus-repository-sonatype ) and JFrog Artifactory ( https://jfrog.com/artifactory/ ). Ideally, internal versioned apps and components would be published to an internal Maven repository for easy internal sharing by developers and users. Additional public repositories exist and may be required for development.
5. **Scala REPL:** The Scala REPL allows Scala developers to write code in a Unix or Windows terminal. Some Scala developers use it frequently, while others seldom do. It’s a nice tool to use for quick prototypes. It requires the local installation of Scala ( https://www.scala-lang.org/download/ ). Another popular option is the Ammonite REPL ( http://ammonite.io ). Scala Worksheets are a nice alternative, supported by Intellij and VSCode/Metals.
6. **Spark REPL:** The Spark REPL is a specialized version of the Scala REPL that allows Scala-Spark developers to write Spark code in a Unix or Windows terminal. It requires the local installation of Spark ( https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html ).
7. **Slack:** A messaging-collaboration tool ( https://slack.com ) for development teams.
8. **VPN:** Provides developers with secure access to public and private networks.
9. **Local Services:** It’s pragmatic and cost-effective to build Scala prototypes and run integration tests against local services, such as Kafka, Cassandra, Postgresql, etc. Homebrew, for instance, simplifies the management of local OSX services. Docker is an alternative.
10. **CI/CD:** Continuous integration and deployment is standard. Jenkins ( https://jenkins.io ) allows a team to set up a build project for each project housed in a Git repository. Scheduled Jenkins jobs pull a Git repository, rebuild it, run tests, run integration tests and package it. Continuous deployment is an optional feature. Github, Gitlab and other companies provide CI/CD services.
11. **Agile:** Github provides a free Kanban Board for each repository, allowing developers to manage project tasks. Gitlab also provides a Kanban Board feature. Atlassian ( https://www.atlassian.com ) provides a robust set of commercial agile tools.
12. **Laptop:** Scala developers typically develop on a MacBook, configured with a 13-16" screen, 16GB/32GB of RAM and **Admin** rights. Windows and Linux laptops are viable alternatives.
13. **Homebrew:** The ultimate software package manager for OSX ( https://brew.sh ).
14. **Sdkman:** A lightweight complement to Homebrew ( https://sdkman.io ) that runs on OSX, Windows and Linux.
15. **Pathfinder:** The ultimate file system browser for OSX ( https://cocoatech.com/#/ ).
16. **Linux Server:** Providing developers with access to a remote Linux development server is ideal and cost-effective ( given the limitations of laptops ).
